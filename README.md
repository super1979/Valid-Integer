# This is a bash script written for an assignment in my Master's course.
# A script that prompts the user to enter a three-digit numeric code (integer) that is either greater than or equal to 200 but less than or equal to 299.
# The value input by the user is validated to ensure that it is within the range specified above.
# The script detects and rejects invalid inputs and prompt the user to try again.
# The input process continues until a valid input made by the user.
# Once a valid input has been entered by the user, echo a message to the screen that a valid input has been made and the script is then terminated.
# Code will not be updated.
